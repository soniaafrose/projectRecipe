<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This chocolate cake is made with cocoa and hot coffee. It has been in my family forever. The secret is to not overbake it — that will ruin a chocolate cake every time.</p>
<p>The dessert is easy to make and most of the people like it.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 cups white sugar</li>
<li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 cup hot, strong coffee</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and baking soda. Add oil, milk, eggs, and vanilla; mix until smooth. Stir in hot coffee last. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.</li><br>recipe: https://www.allrecipes.com, Cover Picture: Shima Apu<p></p>
